# CCOM_planner
Go planner for CCOM ASV

## Requirements
I'm using go version <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">go1.10.3</a> and gccgo (GCC) 8.2.1, so those (or newer) should work for you.

## Instructions
To use, clone the repository and change directories to the root of the project. 
There are scripts to build and run the planner but they just call <code>go build main.go</code> and <code>./main</code> respectively.
